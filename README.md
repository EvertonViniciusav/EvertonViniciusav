ðŸ‘‹ **Hello!** My name is Everton VinÃ­cius, I am 21 years old and I am passionate about technology and innovation. Currently, I am studying System Development at Senac/MS. Throughout my journey, I have completed several courses focused on technology and development, always seeking to expand my knowledge and skills in the field.

ðŸ“š In addition, I have a degree as an Agricultural Technician from the Federal Institute of Mato Grosso do Sul. This education has given me a broad and interdisciplinary perspective, enriching my ability to solve problems and find innovative solutions for agriculture.

ðŸ’» In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and working on personal projects that challenge me and help me grow as a developer. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and collaborate on interesting projects.

ðŸ”— Feel free to explore my repositories and follow my journey in the world of system development!
